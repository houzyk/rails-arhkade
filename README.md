# Arhkade

An Open-source platform for publishing in-browser *Vanilla JS* games.


## Contributing

To contribute, create a folder with at-least the 3 following files: index.html, index.css and index.js. Your whole game should be contained within these files and coded only in HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS. You can then make a github page of that game. To publish it on Arhkade, simply make a branch and a PR to this repo with your game folder at the root of the project. in the html, add a comment where you specify the link to the github page and your github repo for game (if you have any).
